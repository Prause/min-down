## min-down - A Minimal Up-/Download WebApp

This is a minimalistic up- and download webapp. It runs bottle.py with python3
in the background and the usual HTML5,CSS,JS combination on the client side.

This app is meant to be played around with, to be learnt from (observe the
object oriented usage of bottle.py ;) ), re-used for other projects or to serve
the simple need of an easy-to-use, fast-to-deploy up- and download webapp.

Just run

```
python3 app.py
```

and the app will be up and running on port 8899.
(Go to http://localhost:8899/ in your browser)
